  "body": "We'd like to provide further insight into how we rank restaurants within a particular locale. For restaurants, TripAdvisor offers three sorting options that users can utilize to find the most suitable choices: Highest Rating, Relevance, and Featured.\n\n1. Highest Rating:\nThis sorts restaurants based on reviews submitted by travelers. The ranking considers the recency, quality, and quantity of reviews to reflect current customer experiences.\n\n2. Relevance:\nThis sorts restaurants according to how well they match the user's preferences and selections. It takes into account the user’s browsing history, preferences, and activity on TripAdvisor to personalize the results.\n\n3. Featured:\nThe Featured ranking considers a combination of page views, reviews, and specific attributes such as price range, cuisine, and location. It also includes aggregated TripAdvisor data that compares user interactions across all restaurant pages within the same area.\n\nAdditional Details About the Featured Ranking:\n- It is based on what users are actively searching for in a specific location, including factors such as popular cuisines, price points, reviews, photos, and other relevant information.\n- This sorting system does not prioritize revenue from listings.\n- It considers whether a restaurant offers reservations, but it does not favor any particular reservation provider.\n- The \"Highest Rating\" also influences the \"Featured\" ranking, meaning a restaurant’s position in the review system impacts its placement in the Featured results.\n- This \"Featured\" sorting system is the default view when users explore top restaurants in an area. Since it reflects current user interests and preferences, we believe it provides the most relevant guidance to help diners make informed choices.\n\nWe hope this explanation clarifies how our ranking system works. If you have any additional questions or need further assistance, please don’t hesitate to contact us."
