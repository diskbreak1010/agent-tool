  "body": "We would like to explain how the price range displayed at the top of your listing is determined. This visual indicator (using symbols like “$”, “$$-$$$”, or “$$$$”) reflects the typical pricing of your dishes:\n\n- “$” (Cheap Eats): Dishes priced from $2.01 to less than $10.00 USD\n- “$$-$$$” (Mid-Range): Dishes priced from $10.00 to less than $40.00 USD\n- “$$$$” (Fine Dining): Dishes priced at $40.00 USD and above\n\nThis classification is primarily based on online menu prices, reviews mentioning pricing, and comparisons with similar restaurants in your area.\n\nPlease ensure your menu prices are current and aligned with your actual offerings. Changes to your online menu prices and review feedback can influence how your price range is displayed."
